# Passer Rating for Mac
## Draft -- not for publication
### Fritz Anderson
### Xcode 4 Unleashed

_Xcode 4 Unleashed_ will demonstrate Xcode by working through some sample projects. This project is _Mac Passer Rating_, a Mac OS X application that calculates professional-football passer ratings for a field of 43 quarterbacks on 16 teams. 

The sample code for the project will be released as a GitHub repository. **This is not that repository.** It is my own working copy of the app, which I will later refine into step-by-step, chapter-tagged revisions for the reader to follow.
